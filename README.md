Hi, I'm Josue Barreno Z! ðŸ‘‹, This is a github site about me!

# ðŸš€ About Me
I am a developer, entrepreneur and lover of books, new technologies, good food and kindness in general. I read and write plain text, code, among other things. I am following since 2013 -2014 the cryptocurrency movement and my experience has been as volatile as cryptocurrency prices. I am finishing some studies, so this introduction will change at some point.
# ðŸ”— Links
Soon..
